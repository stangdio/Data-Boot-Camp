# Data-Boot-Camp

We participated in the beginner track of the Halloween Challenge at **STADS Data Boot Camp 2025**. Through this project, we gained hands-on experience with machine learning basics and strengthened our teamwork skills.

### Key Activities & Learnings:
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, formatting data, and preparing datasets for analysis.
- Data Visualization: Exploring patterns and insights through visual plots.
- Introduction to Machine Learning: Applied basic ML techniques to the challenge dataset.

This project was a great hands-on experience to get started with machine learning in a practical, collaborative setting.
